Does financial markets punish the security breaches?
The following visualization shows that financial markets do not punish the security breaches as the stock market trend has shown a constant increase.
Discrepencies in this visulaization:
1. No information as such how the stock trend has grown is shown
2. Major factors for security breaches are not given anywhere.
3. Which entity is affected by what type of security breaach is also an unknown factor here.

Improvements:
This visualization shows the suggested improvements:
1. It can be seen simultaneously that the number of records lost and the stock prices trend through 12 years which clearly shows that the price has increased even though the breaches have occured.
2.The major causes of these breahes are collectively shown which gives us the information about the major threats.
3.Entity wise reasons can be seen for the security breaches which can help the entities to work in that domain to protect their information.
